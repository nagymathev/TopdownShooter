# TopdownShooter
 topdown shooter game with score and increasing difficulty


# ToDo list: (in roughly priority order)
- Actual game over screen (display score, restart)
- High score list :) (also needs name entry)
- Game balancing, difficulty tweaking (waves timing and difficulty progression, weapons, health, powerups, enemies' speed, health, etc)
- Make the wave "wait for empty" option work
- Graphics for various things:
-  powerups,
-  weapons,
-  enemies,
-  character,
-  damage, kills (e.g. bug blood that stays on the ground instead of explosion) 
-  enemies to SHOW when they attack ("animation"; they )
- Audio for various things:
-  footsteps
-  damage, kills (e.g. bug squeak)
- Camera (how should it scale? should we add scrolling? at the very least find a good enough size for fullscreen)
- Main menu
- Intro sequence

# MAKE A BUILD!

## Potential extra ideas:
- environment: potentially larger world, obstacles, etc
- melee attack? (e.g. kick; sometimes i don't want to waste "good" ammo on just one enemy)
- dash?
- bullet lifetime? (distance)
- grenade?
- more enemy types?

## Bugs?
